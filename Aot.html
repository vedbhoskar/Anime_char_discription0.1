        <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>-Levi Ackerman</b>
            <br>A titan form would only slow Levi down â€”
            <br> the time to transform is all he needs to finish a fight.
            <br>. If he wasn't injured in his recent fight with Zeke, he would have greatly
            <br> shortened the story by easily killing Eren and Zeke before the rumbling started.
            <br>Levi is the centerpiece for all the best fights in the show. From flighting Kenny's squad to one of the many 
            <br>wins against the Beast Titan, Levi makes short work against any enemy, titan or human.
            <br>He is also known as humanity's strongest soldier.</i></p>

        <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>-Eren Yeager<u>( Attack titan)</u></b>
            <br>The Attack Titan is already one of the strongest, royal blood or not.
            <br> Eren's rage against his enemies and drive for freedom make him incredibly dangerous to anyone who
            <br> stands in his way. Now, having the powers of the rumbling,
            <br>. Eren would not hesitate to rush any enemy with an unending mass of colossal titans. Also, having the 
            <br>ability to control pure titans, Eren is now the sole controller of non-shifter titan powers in the world.
            <br> His lack of empathy for enemies may make him one of the biggest murderers in anime history.

        <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>-Ymir Fritz<u>( Founding titan)</u></b>
            <br>Ymir was the first titan whose power was so great that even after her death,
            <br> her power gave birth to the nine titans. Even after her death, Ymir is incredibly powerful and
            <br> holds the true power of the founding titan within the coordinate.
            <br>While she takes orders from those of royal blood, she is shown to have free will and follows them
            <br> by choice. Within the coordinate, she builds new titans and is 
            <br>able to grant control of the rumbling to whoever she decides.</i></p>

        <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>-Mikasa Ackerman</b>
            <br>Being an Ackerman, it's no wonder Mikasa has survived this long. Always being important in many
            <br> Titan shifting fights, Mikasa shows the upper limits of blades and thunder spears.
            <br> Mikasa held her own against the female Titan and is the one who got the finishing 
            <br>blow on Reiner in Shiganshina. She was also able to take the full focus of the Warhammer titan,
            <br> both dodging its attacks and would have quickly won if it held its shifter in the nape.</i></p>

        <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>-Eren Smith</b>
            <br>While Erwin is a strong soldier who can use ODM gear efficiently against pure titans, his true 
            <br>strength comes from his strategic mind and leadership abilities. Erwin, time and time again,
            <br> shows that he knows how to win a battle, and his willingness to take incredible
            <br> risks makes him very dangerous to his opponents.Marley is lucky this man didn't make it because 
            <br>a war would only let his abilities shine brighter. His leadership abilities also led to the defeat of
            <br> the Beast titan in the battle of Shiganshina when he personally led the 
            <br>Scouts to their death but to victory.</i></p>

            <br>The Beast Titan with Royal Blood, the wonder boy of Marley, and Grisha's firstborn son.
            <br> Zeke has proven his immense power over other titans on and off-screen,
            <br> most to Reiner's expense.The Beast Titan wiped out an entire fleet of warships in a single
            <bR> throw and finished off most of the scout regiment in only a few throws. Being of Royal Blood,
            <br> Zeke's titan is even more powerful than previous owners.</i></p>
