   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Naruto</b>
    <br> Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan.
    <br>He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned
    <br> by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard
    <br> to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.
    <br> In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded
    <br> as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the 
    <br>world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
    <br> He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and
    <br> become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</i></p>

    alt="sasuke" width="250" height="400" class="center">
   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Sasuke</b>
    <br>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of
    <br> Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their
    <br> clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. 
    <br>He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend,
    <br> Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress,
    <br> he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge.
    <br> His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding,
    <br> irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international
    <br> criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving
    <br> instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being 
    <br>happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and 
    <br>dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred
    <br> to as the "Supporting Kage"</i></p>

   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Kakashi</b>
    <br>Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan.
    <br> Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one
    <br> of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike
    <br> of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork;
    <br> he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha.
    <br> After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage
    <br> (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).</i></p>

    alt="madara" width="550" height="400" class="center">
   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Madara</b>
    <br>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha Clan.
    <br> He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju,
    <br> with the intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to
    <br> achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended
    <br> in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding
    <br> to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted
    <br> his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived,
    <br> only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of
    <br> his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</i></p>
   
   
   <div style="color: #ffffff;"><h2><b><u>5.Itachi Uchiha:</u></b></h2></div>

    alt="itachi" width="400" height="300" class="center">
   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Obito</b>
    <br>The fact that the main antagonist of the entire series happened to be Kakashi's childhood friend was
    <br> a reveal that was well-constructed... although one can argue that the instances following this
    <br> reveal diminished Obito's character somewhat.That being said, one can't deny
    <br> that Obito's power was virtually limitless. His Kamui is the stuff of legends, and his
    <br> transformation into the Ten-Tails Jinchuuriki made him even more of
    <br> a threat. If it wasn't for Naruto's powerful words of action, Obito
    <br> could've easily won the Fourth Shinobi World War single-handedly.</i></p>

  
   <div style="color: #ffffff;"><h2><b><u>9.Minato Namikaze:</u></b></h2></div>

    alt="Minato Namikaze" width="300" height="400" class="center">
   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Minato </b>
    <br>It was only a matter of time before Konoha's Yellow Flash would make an appearance on this list. 
    <bR>The father of the series' protagonist was a mystery for the longest time, and it's only a 
    <br>given that Naruto's father would be none other than the Fourth Hokage himself.
    <br>Anyone who's seen the series can understand as to why the Fourth Hokage bags a spot on
    <br>this list — his speed, power, and skills are truly unmatched, and only the
    <br>most powerful shinobi could even stand a chance against him in a one-on-one battle.</i></p>

    alt="Hashirama Senju" width="450" height="400" class="center">
   <p style="color: #fffdfd;"><i><b>-Hashirama </b>
    <br>It would be impossible to talk about powerful figures in the world of Naruto without mentioning the first Hokage himself.
    <br> A practitioner of the original Wood Style jutsu, it's easy to see why Hashirama is considered by many to
    <br> be one of the strongest characters in Naruto.His legacy is the stuff of legend, with most people referencing
    <br>his battles with Madara Uchiha when it comes to showcasing why he's such a
    <br> powerful and revered figure in the world of the shinobi.</i></p>
